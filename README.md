Nearly _everything_ in Ruby is an object. What exactly is an object, though? An object is a programming construct comprised of attributes and actions. Its attributes are its data, and its actions are its methods. Take the string `"popcorn"`, for instance. It's an object with a length attribute of 7. That is, you can describe it as having 7 characters in it. It also has actions, or methods like `reverse` and `upcase`. In this lesson, you'll learn about how to create 'blueprints' (known as **classes**), which allow us to build Ruby objects modeled after real world systems and relationships. Ever wonder how Facebook can have over one billion users, or how a video game can have hundreds of detailed characters? The answer is object orientation.
